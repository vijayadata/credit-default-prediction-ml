# Credit Default Prediction using Machine Learning
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit default risk using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze customer data and build predictive models to classify whether a customer is likely to default on a loan.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Kaggle Dataset

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Credit Default Dataset
- Features include demographic details, financial attributes, and repayment history

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data extraction from Kaggle
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding & scaling
- Train-test split
